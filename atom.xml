    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is more about an idea I had, than about its actual implementation.</p>

<p>Test-driven Shader Development</p>

<h2>Base idea</h2>

<p>When doing shader development,
be it for R&amp;D purposes or in a production environment,
you will run into a couple of possible issues:<br/>
-   shader not compiling<br/>
-   shader not linking (in GL)<br/>
-   shader not running due to wrong input<br/>
-   shader running but not giving the expected result (algorithmic error)<br/>
-   shader not returning the expected result due to wrong input<br/>
-   wrong output from one shader breaking another shader (happens often when playing with lighting models)<br/>
-   shader computationally too heavy (instruction-bound or texture-fetch-bound)<br/>
-   a lot of other stuff that can go wrong, and by Murphy&#8217;s law, will go wrong.</p>

<p>In many of these cases,
nailing the problem down to a few causes,
at best a single one,
will allow for fast solutions
and let the programmer focus on the more interesting parts.</p>

<h2>Compiler/Driver issues</h2>

<p>Those are mostly issues related to building and loading the shader.</p>

<p>The straightforward solution is to implement hot reload,
i.e. reloading while the engine or test environment is running,
and this everytime the shader file is saved.</p>

<p>The apported benefit is that this will allow for shader cooking,
i.e. editing and tweaking of the shader depending on its &#8220;visual&#8221; result.<br/>
(One of the features I loved on CryENGINE3, and that I&#8217;m totally missing on the current engine at work).</p>

<p>An optimization to this:<br/>
reload everytime a hash value depending on the full shader source,
i.e. the <code>main</code> function file and all of its includes, changes.</p>

<h2>Input issues</h2>

<p>The straightforward solution is to have &#8220;static&#8221; inputs.
Those can be:<br/>
-   static textures to simulate a GBuffer<br/>
-   static camera values<br/>
-   static uniform settings<br/>
-   static vertex settings</p>

<p>In the same idea, being able to tweak parameters and see its outcome is likely to help finding input values that lead to computational errors. (Div-by-zero anyone?).</p>

<h2>Output issues</h2>

<p>This kind of issues can be caught by creating a difference image to either<br/>
-   a &#8220;reference&#8221; image (e.g. created through raytracing instead of rendering)<br/>
-   the last &#8220;good&#8221; result image</p>

<p>The frame &#8220;correctness&#8221; is the amount of errors/differences in relation to the reference image.</p>

<h2>Algorithmic issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>using &#8220;random&#8221; inputs

<ul>
<li>shuffle inputs several times, test if output is correct</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Saving the tests</h2>

<p>A great addition for this kind of framework is to save the test &#8220;artifacts&#8221; (in Jenkins&#8217; terms) along with its inputs to allow for later reproducibility.<br/>
-   inputs: the shader files, static input values, user input values<br/>
-   artifacts as such would be: random input values, output frames</p>

<h2>Generalization</h2>

<p>Such a framework would be great to be generalized to work with both Direct3D (several versions, but at least DX9.5 for Xenon and DX11.1) and OpenGL (several versions as well, but ES2 would make my day).
And support for the exots like GX2 (&#8220;Caf√©&#8221;) and GCM (PS3, Vita). (The shader in latter systems are based on GLSL and Cg, respectively, making the porting easier).</p>

<p>Furthermore, OpenCL and ComputeShaders would equally profit fropm such a system.
(As would SPU jobs do, but that&#8217;s limited to a certain type of hardware).</p>

<p>A general solution would allow to have &#8220;any&#8221; kind of data
processed by &#8220;any&#8221; kind of &#8220;processor&#8221;, be it DX, GL, CL or C++AMP.</p>

<p><strong> tl;dr</strong> Is there some student/grad student that would feel like implementing such a system as a master/diploma/doctorate thesis?</p>

    <link href="http://KageKirin.github.com/blog/2012/04/04/jekyll-plugin-for-graphviz/"/>
    <updated>2012-04-04T23:28:00+09:00</updated>
    <id>http://KageKirin.github.com/blog/2012/04/04/jekyll-plugin-for-graphviz</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I stumbled over this small Jekyll plugin for Octopress
which allows to use <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">graphviz</a> notation inside a blog post.<br/>
<a href="http://dryman.github.com/blog/2012/04/04/jekyll-graphviz-plugin/">original link</a></p>

<p>Obviously, you need to have graphviz installed on your generating system.
(<code>port install graphviz</code> should do it if you have MacPorts installed, or well, <a href="http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/">Brew</a>).</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a short test</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src='http://KageKirin.github.com/images/graphviz/g-814c842ea2145a0e16e4d204de389c7a.svg'&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>should give the diagram below:</p>

<p><img src='http://KageKirin.github.com/images/graphviz/g-57023c2552f7752921d58001f1867c02.svg'></p>

<p>Now, where I see great use for this plugin (and probably gonna use it in the future), is to generate UML diagrams to describe a given architecture, flow charts to describe data or work flows, or schemata describing some algorithm.</p>

<p>You probably should install the plugin from
<a href="https://github.com/dryman/dryman.github.com/blob/src/plugins/graphviz_block.rb">its repository</a>
or wait until it has been integrated into the mainline Octopress branch.</p>

<p>And for the hardcore coders, it should be possible to add it to Mulberry/Toura as well, as it&#8217;s based on Jekyll as well.
(Although I see hardly any need to generate diagrams for an app. Then again, there might be a need for it).</p>

<p>EDIT: I just saw a perfect application for graphs in an app that I&#8217;m working on, namely, a diagram for tournaments or championships, to show how the candidates (fighters in this case) advance from round to round.</p>

<p><em>Routes</em> manage high-level application state.</p>

<p><em>Components</em> receive and render data and react to user input.</p>

<p><em>Capabilities</em> provide data to components and broker communications between them.</p>

<p><em>Page definitions</em> are reusable groupings of components and capabilities.</p>

    <updated>2012-03-14T01:00:00+09:00</updated>
    <id>http://KageKirin.github.com/blog/2012/03/14/mulberry-jam-contd</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Follow up on last week&#8217;s post about Mulberry.</p>

<p>There have been a couple of changes with Xcode 4.3, iOS 5.1 and some updates in Mulberry that gave me a hard time&#8230;
In the end, I had to re-scaffold my test-apps from scratch and move my content over because of a few noteworthy changes.<br/>
Incidentally, those changes concern the parts I did not treat in detail in my last post (or just brushed over without investigating it into depth),
thus this follow-up makes a lot of sense.</p>

<p>Giving the demo-app &#8220;kitchensink&#8221; (located in <code>demos</code>) a closer look cleared a couple of questions I still had, so here I go:</p>

<h2>Customization</h2>

<h3>Page-defs</h3>

<p>A page-def defines the template for generated pages, i.e. the layout, components and capabilities to be used on a page.<br/>
Custom page-defs can be generated with the command below:</p>

<pre><code>mulberry create page_def &lt;name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which will create a file at <code>&lt;app-root&gt;/page_defs/&lt;name&gt;.yml</code>.<br/>
More info <a href="https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/wiki/Page-Definitions">here</a></p>

<p>All pre-existing page-defs lie in <code>&lt;mulberry-root&gt;/base_apps/toura/page_defs</code> and have their purpose written in their name, making it easy to guess what they may be intended for.<br/>
Here&#8217;s a list of them, subject to changes as new versions arise:</p>

<pre><code>audio-with-images-phone.yml
audio-with-images-tablet.yml
debug.yml
default.yml
favorites.yml
feed-item.yml
feed-list-phone.yml
feed-list-tablet.yml
full-screen-images.yml
google-map-phone.yml
google-map-tablet.yml
grid-view.yml
home-phone.yml
home-tablet.yml
home-with-header-phone.yml
home-with-header-tablet.yml
hotspots.yml
images-and-text-phone.yml
images-and-text-tablet.yml
location-list.yml
node-gallery.yml
search.yml
videos-and-text-phone.yml
videos-and-text-tablet.yml
</code></pre>

<p>If you are creating your own page-defs for more than one project, it would probably make sense to put them inside this folder (and to commit them back to the Mulberry project in order to contribute to it).</p>

<p>A page-def defines which components will be visible for pages based on it. E.g.:</p>

<pre><code>home-with-header-phone:
  screens:
  - name: index
    backgroundImage: true
    regions:
    - className: header-image
      components:
      - PageHeaderImage

    - scrollable: true
      components:
      - BodyText
      - ChildNodes

    - className: nav
      components:
      - AppNav
</code></pre>

<h3>Components</h3>

<pre><code>mulberry create component &lt;name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which will create a Dojo UI component at <code>&lt;app-root&gt;/app/components/&lt;name&gt;.js</code> and <code>&lt;app-root&gt;/app/components/&lt;name&gt;/&lt;name&gt;.haml</code>).<br/>
See <a href="https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/wiki/Creating-Custom-Components">here</a> for more info.</p>

<h3>Capability</h3>

<p><strong>obsolete</strong></p>

<pre><code>mulberry create capability &lt;name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which will create a file at <code>&lt;app-root&gt;/javascript/capabilities/&lt;name&gt;.js</code>.<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/wiki/Capabilities">More info</a></p>

<h3>Datasource</h3>

<pre><code>mulberry create datasource &lt;name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which will create a JSON file at <code>&lt;app-root&gt;/assets/data/&lt;name&gt;.json</code>. It can hold any data (as long as it&#8217;s valid JSON) and it&#8217;s up to the app to implement the functionality to read and use it.</p>

<h3>Feature flags</h3>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/wiki/Feature-Flags">here</a> for info on feature flags that determine whether a given feature is active or not.</p>

<h2>Xcode-side customization</h2>

<h3>App Icon, Splash Screen, and Project file</h3>

<p>When generating the app, the default PhoneGap app icon and splash screen, as well as the default Toura (xcodeproj) projects are copied into the app&#8217;s <code>&lt;app-root&gt;/build</code> folder,
where they can be further customized. (Although I&#8217;m not sure if re-generating the app overwrites the customized versions).</p>

<p>The source files are located at <code>&lt;mulberry-root&gt;/builder/project_templates/iOS/Toura</code> for the projects and further below in <code>&lt;mulberry-root&gt;/builder/project_templates/iOS/Toura/Resources/icons</code>
and <code>&lt;mulberry-root&gt;/builder/project_templates/iOS/Toura/Resources/splash</code> respectively for icons and splash screens.</p>

<p>It would be a nice extension to Mulberry if I could refer to my custom icons, loading screens, etc. in the config.yml and having those replace the default versions.</p>

<h3>Universal build</h3>

<p>At the moment, the iPhone and iPad have 2 separate projects (<code>Toura.xcodeproj</code> and <code>Toura-iPad.xcodeproj</code>).
But I guess, having a third <code>Toura-universal.xcodeproj</code> for universal apps might be another welcome extension.</p>

<h3>Automatic build</h3>

<p>Command line and Jenkins integration
<a href="http://nachbaur.com/blog/building-ios-apps-for-over-the-air-adhoc-distribution">This link</a> looks helpful.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> I hope this short guide was useful to you.<br/>
I&#8217;ve created a <a href="http://KageKirin.github.com/help/mulberry-cheat-sheet.html">help page</a> and although it&#8217;s more a reminder for myself, you can use it as an easy overview.</p>

    <updated>2012-03-07T01:00:00+09:00</updated>
    <id>http://KageKirin.github.com/blog/2012/03/07/mulberry-jam</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been tinkering with <a href="http://mulberry.toura.com">Mulberry/Toura</a> (read Mulberry by Toura) lately. It&#8217;s surprisingly easy how you can create a simple app.
For my needs, a simple &#8220;information app&#8221;, it&#8217;s really perfect.<br/>
But since I had some starter issues, here&#8217;s a short tutorial on what I did.<br/>
Note: I will mostly cover the iOS apps development process since I just happen to have this hardware.
(OK, me not wanting to bother with installing Eclipse at the moment is the other perfectly valid reason).</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>You can install Mulberry from the <a href="http://mulberry.toura.com/download/">release package</a> or by cloning its <a href="https://github.com/Toura/mulberry">git repo on GitHub</a>. I recommend you to do the latter because it&#8217;s easier to get updates.
In fact, you should fork it first, then clone your fork, and finally add the official repo as another remote.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Toura/mulberry/tree/master/install/osx">installation</a> script will install all the missing parts but you will need to have Java and Xcode4 (on OSX, obviously) installed beforehand.</p>

<p>Although the installation script should fetch everything automatically, there are 2 points that need attention:<br/>
-   the PhoneGap version that comes with it lags 2 minor revisions behind (1.5.0 was just released), so you will want to update PhoneGap from the <a href="link%20here">official release</a> (or its GitHub repo if you&#8217;re feeling like it).
-   Ruby 1.9.2 might fail to install on OSX for some reason.</p>

<p>Actually, if you&#8217;re installing from the GitHub clone, just modify the reference to PhoneGap 1.3.0 to the new version in <code>install.sh</code> like this (starting around line 133, and search-and-replace is your friend):</p>

<p>RVM has issues installing Ruby 1.9.3 on OSX for some reasons. :(<br/>
But you can install Ruby 1.9.2 (i.e. leave your Ruby installation for Octopress as it is) and change the reference to Ruby in the <code>.rvmrc</code> to:</p>

<pre><code>rvm use 1.9.2@mulberry
</code></pre>

<p>The (probably safer) alternative way is to modify <code>install.sh</code> again to install Ruby 1.9.2 instead. (Again, search-and-replace works miracles for that).</p>

<p>The install script will add a few lines to <code>.bash_profile</code>. You might need to adapt this to your installation. (<code>.profile</code> is usually the default shell config on OSX).</p>

<h2>Hello Mulberry and Terminology</h2>

<p>In Mulberry&#8217;s terms, creating the base for an app is called <em>to scaffold</em>, so this is the first command to invoke.<br/>
Note that you have to be inside the folder you installed Mulberry to for it to work. (That&#8217;s an issue related to RVM, afaik).</p>

<p>In my setup, I created an folder called <code>Apps</code> in the root folder of Mulberry and symbolically linked it to ~/Documents/Coding/Apps so I can retrieve it easily.</p>

<p>To create the scaffolding of your very own app, in <code>&lt;mulberry-root&gt;/&lt;my-apps&gt;</code>, just run</p>

<pre><code>mulberry scaffold HelloMulberry
</code></pre>

<p>which will an app called <code>HelloMulberry</code> in the folder <code>&lt;mulberry-root&gt;/&lt;my-apps&gt;/HelloMulberry</code> in this case. Note that the folder should not exist prior to running the command, or else the command will most probably fail.</p>

<p><strong>Note for git</strong>: since your project will lie inside mulberry&#8217;s root folder, it will be tracked by the base repo.
To change this, you could move the app folder to some temp folder, run <code>git init</code> there and move it back (and <code>git submodule add</code> it if required).</p>

<p>For all the remaining commands to work, you need to be inside the folder created for your app.</p>

<p>Once the <code>scaffold</code> command has returned safely, you can directly test your app with these commands:</p>

<p>To generate all the pages and create the custom components:</p>

<pre><code>mulberry generate
</code></pre>

<p>To generate and launch a webserver (on port 3001 by default) from where you can access your app in Mobile Safari:</p>

<pre><code>mulberry serve
</code></pre>

<p>To launch the full build process for debug builds, at which end it will start Xcode from where you can Apple-R(un) the app either in the simulator or on your provisioned device:</p>

<pre><code>mulberry test
</code></pre>

<p>Debug builds include the debugging toolbar and uncompressed Javascript.</p>

<p>To launch the full build process for builds ready to be submitted, use</p>

<pre><code>mulberry deploy
</code></pre>

<p>which builds for all devices specified in the <code>config.yml</code>.<br/>
Deploy builds do NOT include the debugging toolbar, nor the uncompressed Javascript.</p>

<p>There is a fully featured demo in <code>&lt;mulberry-root&gt;/demo</code> that is worth checking out as an example. There used to be other apps in previous revisions (which disappeared in a recent update),
but it might be interesting to branch them as well.</p>

<h2>Content creation</h2>

<p>The base command to create new content is</p>

<pre><code>mulberry create &lt;content-type&gt; &lt;name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>with a few exceptions I will explain later.</p>

<h3>Adding pages</h3>

<pre><code>mulberry create page &lt;pagename&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>will create a file at <code>&lt;app-root&gt;/pages/&lt;pagename&gt;.md</code> that contains the basic YAML front matter for defining a page, and some sample text.</p>

<p>To access this newly created page, you need to edit <code>&lt;app-root&gt;/sitemap.yml</code> in order to include it at the correct place in the page hierarchy. It&#8217;s YAML, and it really contains just the hierarchy. Mulberry will arrange the pages to present the links on the subsequent pages in the order you declare them.</p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p-Indicator">-</span> <span class="l-Scalar-Plain">about</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note: all pages lie in <code>&lt;app-root&gt;/pages/</code>, without any folder hierarchy. Good naming (prefixes?) might greatly ease the pain of dealing with lots of pages.</p>

<h3>Adding images, videos and audios</h3>

<p>From my (naive and potentially wrong) understanding of the docs, these kind of <em>assets</em> can be added for visualization/playback to a page with the right page-def (format) to present it.
This also counts for all the other type of implemented assets, or for your custom ones.</p>

<p>Any asset needs to be placed inside the correct folder, which is<br/>
<code>&lt;app-root&gt;/assets/&lt;asset-type&gt;/</code> for the <em>asset</em> file itself,<br/>
<code>&lt;app-root&gt;/assets/&lt;asset-type&gt;/captions/</code> for a <em>caption</em> describing the asset, which is a markdown file with the same name as the asset,<br/>
and the reference to it must be placed inside the page referring to it.<br/>
(Don&#8217;t panic, it&#8217;ll all become much clearer in the example below).</p>

<h4>Example: a sample video</h4>

<ol>
<li>We place our asset <code>sample_video.mp4</code> into <code>&lt;app-root&gt;/assets/videos/sample_video.mp4</code>.</li>
<li>We create the caption <code>sample_video.md</code> in <code>&lt;app-root&gt;/assets/videos/captions/sample_video.md</code>.

<pre><code>touch &lt;app-root&gt;/assets/videos/captions/sample_video.md
</code></pre></li>
<li>We edit <code>sample_video.md</code> as follows (the only YAML front matter needed is the name of the video):

<pre><code>---
name: A sample video
---
This is a sample video.
</code></pre></li>
<li>We create a new page for this video with <code>mulberry create page video_page</code> and edit it as follows:</li>
<li><ol>
<li>We change the page_def to a page able to display the video: <code>videos-and-text-&lt;platform&gt;</code> sounds like a good candidate.

<pre><code>page_def:
    phone: videos-and-text-phone
    tablet: videos-and-text-tablet
</code></pre></li>
<li>We add a reference to our video to the <code>videos</code> list in the front matter:

<pre><code>videos: sample_video.mp4
</code></pre></li>
<li>Optionally, we add a header image and a short describing text inside the markdown area after the front matter.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>


<p>And that&#8217;s it.<br/>
The <code>&lt;app-root&gt;/pages/video_page.md</code> should look like this:</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t mention it, but the video or image has to be in a format readable by the target platform. (JPEG, PNG is fine for pictures, MP4 great for videos, and MP3 an obvious choice for audio).</p>

<p>When re-generating (or serving) the app, the video will be accessible on the page you put it on.</p>

<h3>Adding data, feeds, locations</h3>

<p>Those 3 types of assets can be created from the command line.</p>

<p>To create a data file that can contain custom data to be used by the app, use</p>

<pre><code>mulberry create data &lt;name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which will create a file at <code>&lt;app-root&gt;/assets/data/&lt;name&gt;.yml</code>.</p>

<p>(I haven&#8217;t figured out, what kind of data the docs mean, but I guess it&#8217;s up to the application or a custom component to read and use it).</p>

<p>To create a file associated with an RSS/ATOM feed, use</p>

<pre><code>mulberry create feed &lt;name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which will create a file at <code>&lt;app-root&gt;/assets/feeds/&lt;name&gt;.yml</code>.<br/>
(Note to self: run and see what kind of files are created).</p>

<p>To create a geographic location that gets included in the app, run</p>

<pre><code>mulberry create location &lt;name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which will create a file at <code>&lt;app-root&gt;/assets/locations/&lt;name&gt;.yml</code>.<br/>
(I still need to investigate its format and the use of this).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What will this blog be about?</p>

<p>I stated in my opening post that I will blog about graphics programming, programming on a general level, and add some tadbits about web programming. To concretize this plan, or rather as a TODO list, I wrote this post.</p>

<h2>Papers</h2>

<p>I might want to write (more or less academic) papers and submit them for review. You will find them here as well.</p>

<p>I will probably edit this list over time&#8230;</p>

<p><strong> tl;dr </strong><br/>
I have no clue what I will write about on this blog. But be sure that it&#8217;ll be code-related.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;ve followed this blog, you might have noticed a couple of changes in the last days.
In fact, I&#8217;ve been playing around with customizing Octopress and added a couple of custom asides.</p>

<h2>Coderwall</h2>

<p>I wanted to add my Coderwall badges in the asides. A bit of googling lead me to <a href="http://tzangms.com">another Octopress blog</a>, which was using <a href="http://mizzy.org/blog/2012/01/13/coderwall-badges-on-the-sidebar/">Mizzy</a>&#8217;s code to display the badges. From there, it was pretty easy to extract the Javascript code from the page source. I only found the original author&#8217;s page later today, but by then, I had already a working version.</p>

<p>As customization on the original code, I added the img@alt and img@title attributes to be generated from Coderwall&#8217;s JSON response data. This gives a nice addition for hovering over the badge to get its description, and an alternative description for non-graphic browsers.</p>

<p>The second custom aside I created follows the implementation as described on the official Xbox site, which is using an iframe to embed the card. I don&#8217;t really like the iframe to embed an external page, but this implementation was small and function, which is the essential.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span> (xboxlive.html)</span> <a href='http://KageKirin.github.com/downloads/code/../../_includes/asides/xboxlive.html'>download</a></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'>{% if site.xboxlive_user %}
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;section&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>Xbox Live<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&lt;iframe</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://gamercard.xbox.com/{{site.xboxlive_user}}.card&quot;</span> <span class="na">scrolling=</span><span class="s">&quot;no&quot;</span> <span class="na">frameBorder=</span><span class="s">&quot;0&quot;</span> <span class="na">height=</span><span class="s">&quot;140&quot;</span> <span class="na">width=</span><span class="s">&quot;204&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>{{site.xboxlive_user}}<span class="nt">&lt;/iframe&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/section&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>{% endif %}
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>The coderwall_user and xboxlive_user need to be specified in _config.yml.</p>

<h2>More gamercard services</h2>

<p>Given you have a website that generates nice gamercards (there are ton of thems), you can use the above code to include your custom gamercard as an aside.</p>

<p><strong> tl;dr </strong>
Creating asides is super easy with Jekyll/Octopress. And I&#8217;ll probably create a few more for fun.</p>

    <id>http://KageKirin.github.com/blog/2012/02/19/rediscovering-web-development-2012</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;m not a web developer by birth.
I&#8217;ve done some web development as cheap jobs when I was a student. As such, I knew the vital parts of PHP, some bits of Javascript and of course the HTML4 DOM and the basics of CSS. Just enough to pound out a (-cheap-looking- programmer art) webpage, with MySQL for database support.
That was between 1999 and 2006. Then I graduated.</p>

<p>Not that web development was boring, but since the web bubble just exploded when I was in my 2nd year at University, I had some prejudices to web development being a good career path. Plus, game programming was something I wanted to do since my childhood, and graphics programming was something I studied, I chose the path of a graphics programmer, and not the one of a web developper.</p>

<p>Hence, I didn&#8217;t follow the evolutions that closely.
Well, I saw XHTML coming during the XML boom &#8211; put everything into XML, and if you need the data in a different format, add some XML layer on top of it &#8211; and going, I saw HTML5 arriving to make the web better (and played Apple&#8217;s &#8220;Checkers&#8221; demo countless of times), saw the rise of CSS, to the point of CSS3 (I liked the part where it killed the old tablosaurs), and WebGL arriving (after seeing VRML and X3D dying their all-to-merited death), all that without really taking part in those changes.</p>

<p>And now, in 2012, I finally decided to relaunch my blog in a different form (I had a self-hosted WordPress blog, but I let it die without updates, neither in the form of WP patches, nor in content) and found this Octopress thingy I am using, which looks to me that it&#8217;s using a great bunch of new technologies, that didn&#8217;t ring any bells until now: SASS, Liquid, Jekyll, jQuery, etc.</p>

<p>So I&#8217;m entering totally new terrain, which is both terrifying (in the amount of new stuff to learn) and interesting (in the amount of new stuff to discover) at the same time, and I&#8217;ll be blogging about my discoverings here from time to time.</p>

<p>Besides trying to configure this site to look a bit &#8220;different&#8221; from the vanilla Octopress theme, I have one other motivation to go all this way:
I was asked by some very good friends if I could produce some small iOS app for their organization. Hence I&#8217;ve been spending some time to look into possible solutions to produce an app (possibly not limited to iOS) in the short amount of time I have besides work.</p>

<p>I already knew PhoneGap from some earlier &#8220;research&#8221;, but haven&#8217;t come to use it yet.
But then I found Octopress, and Jekyll as a static page generator as its base, and this idea kinda stuck with me: If I&#8217;m going to put out a little app that&#8217;s going to contain little more than text, I could use those technologies to pound out an app pretty quickly. Modifying the styles could even be done by my friends, and since I could easily host its sources on github, it would make the updates pretty easy.</p>

<p>Looking closer at my requirements, I found out that there&#8217;s already been someone with a similar idea, which has resulted in a project called Mulberry.</p>

<p>Mulberry is based on PhoneGap and Jekyll and allows to generate the &#8220;scaffolding&#8221; of an app for iOS and Android. I&#8217;ve been toying with for a couplke of hours today, but it looks pretty promising.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Web development has gone a long way, and I&#8217;m looking forward to learn more about all these new technologies.
Actually, it&#8217;s awesome to see all the new evolutions of web technologies, and even to be using them.</p>

<p>On this matter of thought, if anyone knows how to put in a WebGL-powered tag cloud for the categories of my posts, I&#8217;d like to hear about it.</p>

    <updated>2012-02-15T23:32:00+09:00</updated>
    <id>http://KageKirin.github.com/blog/2012/02/15/opening-post</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> I hereby declare this blog opened!</p>

<p>Since my old WP blog died of (wilfull) neglect at least 2 years ago, I am starting a new one, and will try to keep it updated regularly. (I don&#8217;t promise anything, though).
My old blog was a more a mixture of political stuff, life blog, and coding, and also written in several languages, meaning that each post was a lot of extra work translating it.
This time, I&#8217;ll keep it easy and blog only about coding stuff, and only in English.</p>

<p>What coding stuff? (There&#8217;s a lot that would merit to be talked about).<br/>
Since I&#8217;m a graphics programmer, there will be posts about graphics programming, i.e. shaders, graphics algorithms.<br/>
But I will also cover more general programming, be it with subjects like refactoring,
&#8220;dark magic&#8221; programming (the arcanes of mixing languages that should better not be mixed &#8211; more on that later), programming languages, etc.<br/>
Also, I plan to write about my learning of C# with Unity3D.<br/>
And since I&#8217;m currently rediscovering a lot of web programming that I just saw passing by in the last years, I will write about that as well.</p>

<p>So far, for what I plan to blog about, but I will write a more specific post with some ideas later.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Like the first words an infant says, a coder starts his &#8220;coder life&#8221; by printing those simple words.</p>

<p>More in detail, the point of creating a program that prints a little message is to prove that the programming statements are understood by the parser, can be translated into an abstract syntax, and finally translated into binary instructions understandable by the machine. In short, if this simple program can be compiled and linked, any other program can be built as well.</p>

<p>As such, there&#8217;s nothing more appropriate as to start this dev blog by stating &#8220;Hello World&#8221;.
I.e. if this post can be generated, any post can be generated.</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>
This looks nicer than a generic lorem ipsum.</p>
