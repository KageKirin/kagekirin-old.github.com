As such, creating the rendering pipeline and the material shaders for the artists is part of my daily work. And to support the game designers, my job is to create post-processing effects that would express a part of the gameplay (e.g. blood screen effect).The <em>programmer</em> part is the technical area, which not only involves, writing code, but also writing clean code, or to clean up (refactor) existing code, adding new features by the way.I see myself first and foremost as a <em>clean</em> coder (term borrowed from &#8216;Uncle Bob&#8217; Martin) having his specialization in rendering technology.As such, I&#8217;m on the never ending &#8220;way of the coder&#8221;, with learning as a lifelong task.And it&#8217;s learning new things, be it from books, co-workers or the great knowledge of the universe (aka Internet), which makes my job fascinating.</p>
