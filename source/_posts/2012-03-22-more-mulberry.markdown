I found [this presentation about Mulberry](http://www.slideshare.net/rmurphey/getting-started-with-mulberry) and wanted to share it.  
It explains the core functionality of Mulberry.

**tl;dr** Thinks to retain:

*Routes* manage high-level application state.

*Components* receive and render data and react to user input.

*Capabilities* provide data to components and broker communications between them.

*Page definitions* are reusable groupings of components and capabilities.

*Stores* persist data on the device, make that data query-able, and return model instances.
