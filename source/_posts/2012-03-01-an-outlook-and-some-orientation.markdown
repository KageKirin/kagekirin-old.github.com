What will this blog be about?

I stated in my opening post that I will blog about graphics programming, programming on a general level, and add some tadbits about web programming. To concretize this plan, or rather as a TODO list, I wrote this post.

## Web programming
Subjects to cover:
- mostly about Octopress, how to, or better, how I customize parts of it.
- some HTML5 and WebGL things I try out.
- things that go hand in hand with the next topic

## App programming
Subjects to cover:
- Using PhoneGap to create web technology-based iOS apps
-- automatizing parts of the build process
- Using Mulberry to create web technology-based iOS apps

## Graphics programming
Subjects to cover:
- Algorithms I implement either at work or at home
- Explanations about graphics algorithms
- Personal research

## General programming
Subjects to cover:
- Refactoring
- Optimization
- Things I run into at work

I will probably edit this over the time...
