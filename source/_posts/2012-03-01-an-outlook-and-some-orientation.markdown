What will this blog be about?

I stated in my opening post that I will blog about graphics programming, programming on a general level, and add some tadbits about web programming. To concretize this plan, or rather as a TODO list, I wrote this post.

## Web programming
Subjects to cover:
-  mostly about Octopress, how to, or better, how I customize parts of it.
-  some HTML5 and WebGL things I try out.
-  things that go hand in hand with the next topic

## App programming
Subjects to cover:
-  Using PhoneGap to create web technology-based iOS apps
  -  automating parts of the build process
-  Using Mulberry to create web technology-based iOS apps
-  Other tools to create iOS apps

## Graphics programming
Subjects to cover:
-  Algorithms I implement either at work or at home
-  Explanations about graphics algorithms
-  Personal research

## General programming
Subjects to cover:
-  Refactoring
-  Optimization
-  Things I run into at work
-  The "dark magic" of language mixing
  -  Preprocessor and templates
  -  Obj-C and C++ templates (I see you gasping in horror at the sheer idea of this).
  -  Preprocessor code generation

## Game programming
Subjects to cover:
-  Algorithms for game logic
-  Framework architecture
-  Other findings

## Unity3D programming
Subjects to cover:
-  C# in Unity
-  Learning progress
-  Shaders in Unity

## Development tools
-  VisualStudio
-  Xcode
-  Perforce (mostly how much I despise this system)
-  Git
-  Mercurial

## Papers
I might want to write (more or less academic) papers and submit them for review. You will find them here as well.

I will probably edit this list over time...

** tl;dr **  
I have no clue what I will write about on this blog. But be sure that it'll be code-related.
