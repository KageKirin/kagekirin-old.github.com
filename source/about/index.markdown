Hi, my name is Chris. I'm a graphics programmer working at Valhalla Game Studios in Tokyo, Japan. Before expatriating, I've been working at Crytek in Frankfurt, Germany, both on the famous CryENGINE3 and titles such as Crysis 2.

The rants I share here represent my own views only, and neither those of my current nor any former employer.
Any article, rant, code or paper I share here is hereby licensed as CC-BY-NC, respectively MIT for code.

KageKirin is my alias for code related stuff. Kage means Shadow (think shader) in Japanese,
and Kirin is a what you get when you tell very imaginative people about a non-local animal they have never seen before (in this case, a giraffe) and let their fantasy play.
(The Ki-Rin is a chimera made out of chinese dragon, deer, and symbolizes good luck. Also it's the protector of the West in chinese mythology. The Ki is the male, and the Rin the female).

Code Alchemist is a reference to the japanese anime "Fullmetal Alchemist", with the connotation that programming is to code what the god-like work of creating something out of nothing is to alchemy,
and refactoring is to take something, i.e. code, apart, only to reput into a different shape, which is also one principle of alchemy.

I hope you'll enjoy reading my posts.

about:graphics programmer

I am graphics programmer.
This job, as I see it, is the chimera of programming jobs:

the *graphics* part makes me the "human interface" to artists and game designers alike, to support and enable them to realize their vision of the game (also to push them to try new approaches to graphics or to give their wishes a more tangible form). As such, creating the rendering pipeline and the material shaders for the artists is part of my daily work. And to support the game designers, my job is to create post-processing effects that would express a part of the gameplay (e.g. blood screen effect).

the *programmer* part is the technical area, which not only involves, writing code, but also writing clean code, or to clean up (refactor) existing code, adding new features by the way.

I see myself first and foremost as a *clean* coder (term borrowed from 'Uncle Bob' Martin) having his specialization in rendering technology.
As such, I'm on the never ending "way of the coder", with learning as a lifelong task.

And it's learning new things, be it from books, co-workers or the great knowledge of the universe (aka Internet), which makes my job fascinating.
