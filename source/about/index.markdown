Hi, my name is Chris. I'm a graphics programmer working at Valhalla Games Studios in Tokyo, Japan. Before expatriating, I've been working at Crytek in Frankfurt, Germany, both on the famous CryENGINE3 and titles such as Crysis 2.

The rants I share here represent my own views only, and neither those of my current nor any former employer.
Any article, rant, code or paper I share here is hereby licensed as CC-BY-NC, respectively MIT for code.

KageKirin is my alias for code related stuff. Kage means Shadow (think shader) in Japanese,
and Kirin is a what you get when you tell very imaginative people about a non-local animal they have never seen before (in this case, a giraffe) and let their fantasy play.
(The Ki-Rin is a chimera made out of chinese dragon, deer, and symbolizes good luck. Also it's the protector of the West in chinese mythology. The Ki is the male, and the Rin the female).

Code Alchemist is a reference to the japanese anime "Fullmetal Alchemist", with the connotation that programming is to code what the god-like work of creating something out of nothing is to alchemy,
and refactoring is to take something, i.e. code, apart, only to reput into a different shape, which is also one principle of alchemy.

I hope you'll enjoy reading my posts.
